= AIMA-GUI =

by Ruediger Lunde (Ruediger.Lunde@gmail.com)

This project contains graphical applications and command line demos, which
demonstrate the use of some of the aima-core project features. Currently, it
focuses on search algorithms and agent concepts. Application class names end
with "App" and command line demo class names end with "Demo".
Simple demo command line applications can be found in package aima.gui.demo.
Graphical demo applications are available based on JavaFX (package aima.gui.fx.applications) and
Swing (package aima.gui.swing.applications). Each platform-specific root package contains an
integrated application providing access to all integrable demos. The individual demos are placed
in sub-packages. Note that JavaFX and Swing demos are structured quite differently.
They use different frameworks (sub-package framework) and also differ in function.

== Requirements ==
# Depends on the aima-core project. 

== Current Release: 1.1.1-AIMA-GUI JavaFX GUIs Added ==
1.1.1-JavaFX GUIs Added : 18 Dec 2016 :<br>
  * Fixed Jar to launch JavaFX Integrated App by default.
  
== Running the GUIs and Command Line Demos ==
Under the release/ directory you should find two jar files, aima-core.jar and aima-gui.jar, ensure these are on your CLASSPATH, the different GUI programs that can be run using these are:
 * java -jar aima-gui.jar
   + this will run the default AimaDemoApp, this allows you to run all other applications from a central location as well as all of the current command line demos.
 
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.swing.demo.vacuum.VacuumApp
   + provides a demo of the different agents described in Chapter 2 for tackling the Vacuum World.
  * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.swing.demo.search.games.EightPuzzleApp
   + provides a demo of the different search algorithms described in Chapter 3 and 4.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.swing.demo.search.games.NQueensApp
   + provides a demo of the different search algorithms described in Chapter 3 and 4.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.swing.demo.search.games.TicTacToeApp
   + provides a demo of the different search algorithms described in Chapter 5.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.swing.demo.search.map.RouteFindingAgentApp
   + provides a demo of the different agents/search algorithms described in Chapters 3 and 4, for tackling route planning tasks within simplified Map environments.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.swing.demo.search.csp.MapColoringApp
   + provides a demo of the different csp algorithms described in Chapters 6.
 
The following command line demos can be run as well:
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.agent.TrivialVacuumProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.learning.LearningProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.DPLLProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.FolProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.PLFCEntailsProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.PLResolutionProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.TTEntailsProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.WalkSatProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.probability.ProbabilityProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.CSPProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.EightPuzzleProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.NQueensProg
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.TicTacToeProg
