Keyword String 1: Things are pretty much objects, subject to observation by *subjects*. 
Keyword String 2: Animals are things, as they are certainly observable by people, and people are subjects.
Keyword String 3: Inanimate objects, non-living objects, are also things. A teapot is a thing, and so is a movie. A painting is a thing, as is a dollar or a coin. 
Keyword String 4: The notion of a thing can also be so broad as to include objects which are not material, such as the state of death, or the feeling of happiness.
